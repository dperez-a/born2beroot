The objective of this project is to recreate the basic behavior of the printf function from the C standard library. The implementation is done using string manipulation techniques and text formatting.

## Features

-Support for basic format specifiers such as %d, %s, %c, %f, etc.

-Handling of format flags such as alignment, padding, precision, etc.

-Basic console printing functionality.
## Usage
